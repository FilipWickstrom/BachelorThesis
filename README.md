# Performance comparison between OOD and DOD with multithreading in games

This is a bachelor thesis written by Filip Wickstr√∂m and David Wingqvist. 
Here we compare two design patterns within the scope of games.
The two design patterns are:
* OOD - Object-oriented design
* DOD - Data-oriented design

Two different games was developed and can be seen in different folders.
* Game 1: Uses OOD and DOD with a self-written ECS. Is also using multithreading (OpenMP) for the two patterns.
* Game 2: Uses OOD and DOD with the ECS library [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)

# How to compile
## Windows
Build the visual studio project with "buildVS.bat". 
It is building for VS2019, but can be easily changed to other versions as well.


## Linux
Use the command "make" to build the game.

# In project
You can play around with different values in the "PCH.h" files for the games to see the differences between the two design patterns.
